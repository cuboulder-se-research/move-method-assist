## Telemetry data

The plugin stores anonymous telemetry data on your local machine. 
It does NOT contain any personal information about you or about the code that you develop. 
Manually sending this telemetry data to us, will help us understand how developers think about the plugin suggestions. 
The recorded information is in a human-readable format, so you can proofread it before sending it to us.


Telemetry data is collected in a file on the local machine of the developer, under the IntelliJ Idea folder
`ref_plugin_logs/ref_telemetry_data.jsonl`. In my case, the full path
is `~/Library/Logs/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2023.1/ef_plugin_logs/ef_telemetry_data.log`.
The data in stored in *JSONL* format. 
Each line in the telemetry file represents a JSON object, parseable by a json parser. You can use [this](https://pprint-ndjson.neverendingqs.com) online formatter to view the contents of your telemetry data before you send it to us.

### How to find the telemetry data file?
